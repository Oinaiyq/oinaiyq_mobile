Hi Team Oinaiyq,

I have noticed that you HAVE NOT pushed your project to GitHub repo... 
I insist that you upload/push your project, AND GET STARTED working on your Project.

THE FINAL GRADES FOR THIS COURSE WILL DEPEND ON HOW MUCH YOU HAVE PROGRESSED ON YOUR PROJECT. 
Therefore, I warn you to pay a lot of attention on the second part of your project development!!! 

Also, I encourage you to create a TO DO list and follow it!!!
